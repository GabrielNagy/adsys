    Define AppArmor profiles to be parsed and loaded on client machines.
    These profiles are ordered, one by line, and relative to the SYSVOL/apparmor/ubuntu/ directory.
    On the client machine, computer profiles are stored in /etc/apparmor.d/adsys/machine, thus the administrator can reference abstractions and tunables shipped with the client distribution of AppArmor.
    Files can be included in each other either using a path relative to the current directory of the profile (include "path/to/profile"), or relying on the include path of AppArmor (include <adsys/machine/path/to/profile>).

    Profiles from this GPO will be appended to the list of profiles referenced higher in the GPO hierarchy.
