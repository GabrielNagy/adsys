  displayname: "Mount points for the client"
  explaintext: |
    Define mount points that will be mounted for the client.
    The order of the mounts will be according to the order the mount points were listed in the policy.
    The mounts listed will be appended to the list of mounts referenced higher in the GPO hierarchy.
    The values will be parsed and any duplicates will be removed (keeping the first value that was seen).
    Anonymous and Kerberos validated mounts will be handled automatically.

    Values should be in the format: 
            protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/mountpath 
    
    And anonymous mounts should have a prefix tag [anonymous] to indicate them, e.g:
            [anonymous]protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/mountpath
