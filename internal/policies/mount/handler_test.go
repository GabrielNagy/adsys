/*
//TODO: Tests for RunMountForCurrentUser and the necessary dbus mock to support it.

Since we use gio to handle the user mounts, we need to mock the dbus calls to be able to test the
RunMountForCurrentUser function and its callbacks.

Right now, the tests would be very similar to the integration tests in
cmd/adsysd/integration_tests/adsysd_mount_test.go.
